## Roadmap
===========================
### Milestone 4: Implement additional snippets
Graphs snippets.
Maps snippets, that could help for a geolocalization/geotracing.

### :heavy_check_mark: Milestone 3: Process with a better TSdb database integration - anyone but SQLite
influxDb branch is live and running.
SQLite still can be activated as backup or alternative - but is deprecated and not maintained.

### :heavy_check_mark: Milestone 2: Dashboard integration
Dashboards are fully integrated into the UI.
Some snippets are available to see graphs, display a simple value (like temperature), or display current date.

### :heavy_check_mark: Milestone 1: API completion
3 resources are fully manageable via Apis. Remaining 3 resources (rules, snippets and dashboards)

### :heavy_check_mark: Milestone 0: API basics and simple UI to manage most of resources.
